### Tachyon Murder

This is a paradox invented by renowned Physicists Richard Muller when teaching
relativity theory at UC Berkeley. He is faced with the question whether "faster
than light travel is possible?" He goes...

My reasoning is strange but compelling: if humans can travel faster than light,
it will demonstrate that free will does not exist. That discovery would sadden
me. The logic is described in detail in my recently published [Now—The Physicsof Time](https://www.amazon.com/Now-Physics-Time-Richard-Muller/dp/0393285235)

#### Tachyon Mrder

The strange relativity result that the order of events can flip for different
reference frames leads us into a new aspect of reality: the deep issues of
causality and free will. These issues can be dramatized by the story of the
tachyon murder.

A tachyon is a hypothetical particle that travels faster than the speed of
light. Remarkably, relativity does not prohibit particles from traveling that
fast. It says only that massless particles must travel at lightspeed, and that
particles that have a real rest mass cannot travel at that speed (since the
gamma factor would be infinite, and they would have infinite energy).
The equations don’t prohibit faster-than-light travel per se….

Yet despite the upside of [discovering a tachyon], I decided many years ago not
to bother searching for a tachyon. My reason borders on the religious. I
believe that I have free will, and the existence of tachyons would violate that
belief. Let me explain.

Imagine that Mary is standing 40 feet away from John. She has a tachyon gun
that fires tachyon bullets that move at 4c, four times the speed of light.
She fires. Light moves at a speed of 1 foot per nanosecond (billionth of a
second), so her tachyons move at 4 feet per nanosecond. In just 10 nanoseconds,
the tachyon bullet enters John’s heart and kills him. Let’s assume he dies
instantly.

Mary is brought to trial. She doesn’t deny any of the facts I just described,
but she insists on an unusual change of venue. She says she has a right to
argue the case in whatever reference frame she chooses. They are all valid,
the judge knows, so he allows her to proceed. She chooses a frame moving at
half lightspeed, ½ c. Since that frame is moving slower than the speed of
light, according to relativity it is a valid reference frame.

In the Earth frame, the two events (fire gun, hit heart) are separated by +10
nanoseconds. As I show in Appendix 1, the same two events described in a
reference frame moving at ½ c have a time separation of –15.5 nanoseconds.
The negative sign means that the two events occur in the opposite order. The
bullet enters the victim’s heart before Mary fires the gun! Mary has the
perfect alibi. John was already dead when she pulled the trigger. You can’t
murder a dead person. She expects to beat the rap.

The tachyon murder example is based on the same relativity principle that
caused confusion in the twin and pole-in-the-barn paradoxes. If two events
are sufficiently separated in space, and not too different in time, then
there will be frames in which the order of events will reverse. Such
distant events are called “space-like.” Two events that occur near each
other but separated in time are called “time-like.” The order of space-like
events depends on the frame of reference; the order of time-like events does
not.

… I refer you to Appendix 1 [of my new book [Now](https://www.amazon.com/Now-Physics-Time-Richard-Muller/dp/0393285235)]
for the explicit calculation. Is the tachyon murder scenario possible? How
could analysis in the ½ c frame be valid, if it has such an absurd implication?
Does this mean that tachyons don’t exist, or does it mean that relativity is
nonsense? What if tachyons are really found? …

One possible resolution for the tachyon murder paradox is that, in this world
that has tachyon guns, Mary does not have free will. Even though she pulled the
trigger after John died, she had no choice but to do so, since without free
will, choice is illusory. All of her actions arise from influences and forces
outside of herself. John died because it was inevitable that Mary would pull
the trigger; the inevitability of physics created the combined scenario of
shooting and death, and the order in which they occurred is irrelevant. There
is no paradox if the world is governed by causal physics equations. The
scenario presents a problem only if you think people have free will, if you
believe that Mary could have decided not to fire the gun. If physics rules,
then she does only what the various forces and influences on her cause her to
do.

So if any normal object, such as you, can travel faster than the speed of
light, it means that free will does not exist. I consider it remarkable to
realize that free will has actual consequences for physics, and that we can
describe a discovery that would falsify it. I don’t think this astonishing
fact has been published prior to my book.
